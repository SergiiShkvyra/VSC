      <p>
        In order to open and close me, we had to add different functionalities.
        Since me and this nice blurry overlay were hidden, we had to remove
        "hidden" functionality when either of the 3 buttons is pressed, this way
        me and the overlay become visible. And in case if you want to close me,
        just click the X in the right top corner of this window, OR hit ESC
        button on your keyboard, OR simply click outside of the window on my
        friend overlay. But if you do so we will miss you üíï
